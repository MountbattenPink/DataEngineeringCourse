# PowerBI dataset transformations and visualizations

This README contains both general data (how I installed, set up components, transformed file)
and the description of visualization.

This project is a sample visualizations implementation based on PowerBI.
It ingests a dataset from source local folder, validates/filters/transforms it,
and visualizates it. 

## 1. Set up and prepare dataset for visualization
1. Dowload and install PowerBI (I didn't need an account or registration for this project)
```
Important: don't repeat mistakes. I installed accidentaly russian-language version. English version will be better.
```
3. Load file AB_NYC_2019.csv as a data source. Open it in Power Query and clean with context menu.
4. Cleaned and transformed file can be found in this repo (AB_NYC_2019_cleaned.csv)
5.  


## 2. Review visualizations
